# Nonogramm

The idea of this Programm is to play the game. Additonal things are to log in and create their own levels and have an organized structure in choosing one. Also there are helper signs to make solving easier. In addition colors are added to the game. The signed user can also create Comment, Levels and like those. Also they can check if they have completed the level.

## Things might to added in the future

* automatic cross for the number if the condition is met e.g. five square lined in a row will automatically cross the number 5 in the row information
* level, comment deletion (not really tested), only user or the administrator are allowed to do that
* animation for completing/failing the ducklevel
* the user can resett the completed level

## Things might not be added in the future

* Highscores for completing the level
